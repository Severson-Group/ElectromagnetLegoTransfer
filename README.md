# LEGO STEM Project Modeling and Design 

In-progress repository of all modelling, CAD files and code for a STEM outreach project utilizing LEGOs and electromagnets.

## Getting Started

### Matlab

All modelling was done in Matlab R2018A.

### LTSpice

For switched mode controller simulation, the TL494.asy needs to be moved to LTSpice's /LTSpiceIV/lib/sym/Misc subdirectory and the
 TL494.sub file into the /LTSpiceIV/lib/sub/ subdirectory.
